<h1 id="aginic-data-generation">Aginic Data Generation</h1>
<p>The project generates data similar to the format present in <em><a href="example.json">example.json</a></em> file.
    Which then converts the json to relational model, by first creating the database and its schema, and then loading
    the records one by one. </p>
<h2 id="build-instructions">Build Instructions</h2>
<h4 id="requirements">Requirements</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Ensure python3 is installed on the command line by running <code>python3</code> in terminal and making sure that
        the shell changes to the python interpreter.
    </li>
    <li>Exit and install the python dependencies using the following command (this installs Faker library used in the
        project for getting random data):
        <pre><code>     python -m pip <span class="hljs-keyword">install</span> -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Install SQLite command line tool by using package manager, e.g., for Debian based distributions:
        <pre><code>     sudo apt-<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> install sqlite3
</code></pre>
        <em>OR</em> you can go <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html">here</a> and download the appropriate
        binaries directly.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="execution">Execution</h4>
<p>CD to the project directory and run the script <code>part4_script.sh</code> using bash. The script has preconfigured
    file name arguments and you can choose to change them if you wish.</p>
<pre><code>    <span class="hljs-keyword">bash </span>part4_script.sh
</code></pre>
<p>All the parameters of the program are defined in the <a href="configuration.py">configuration.py</a> file.
    For example:-</p>
<ol>
    <li>Edit the START_DATE and END_DATE values (lines 8 and 9) to change the scope of the generated ticket&#39;s
        dates.
    </li>
    <li>Similarly, you can change the working hours defined in lines 12 and 13.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="design-decisions">Design Decisions</h2>
<h4 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Only activities with a status field are relevant to the project. The first activity with just a note field is
        not important as it does not provide much information about the status, and hence is not generated.
    </li>
    <li>Status of any ticket proceed in the following order:-
        <ol>
            <li>Open</li>
            <li>Waiting for Customer</li>
            <li>Waiting for Third Party</li>
            <li>Pending</li>
            <li>Resolved</li>
            <li>Closed</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Output of the query in Part 3 is expected in <strong>hours</strong>, for easy understanding of how much time is
        used by any given ticket.
    </li>
    <li><p>The individual columns of Part 3 are defined as following difference in timestamps: -</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Time spent open: for how long the ticket was open
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Waiting for Customer</em> - <em>Open</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Time spent Waiting on Customer: how long did it take for the customer to respond to the ticket
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Waiting for Third Party</em> - <em>Waiting for Customer</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Time spent waiting for response (Pending Status): how long was the ticket in pending state
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Resolved</em> - <em>Pending</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Time till resolution: how long did it take for a ticket to go from open to resolved
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Resolved</em> - <em>Open</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p>Time to first response: When was the customer first contacted after generation of the ticket</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Timestamp of first occurrence of _contacted<em>customer = True</em> for a ticket -
                        <em>Open</em></p>
                        <p> Note: Initially, It seemed like this last time was equal to the first time, i.e. <em>Waiting
                            for Customer</em> - <em>Open</em>, but after carefully reading the example, I saw that I can
                            use the boolean &#39;contacted_customer field&#39; for this purpose. The code was hence
                            modified to have a random number of &#39;False&#39; values for the earlier activities, and
                            &#39;True&#39; for the rest.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="python">Python</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Python is the language of choice for writing data generation and handling scripts.</li>
    <li>It was a requirement specified for Part 1 of this challenge, and hence was the logical successor for solving the
        rest.
    </li>
    <li>All the necessary constants were defined in separate files for easy access throughout the project: <em><a
            href="configuration.py">confg</a></em> and <em><a href="sqlHelpers.py">SQL</a></em>
        <ul>
            <li>Lists like Group, Category, etc. definitions can be changed according to need, and all the scripts will
                just work without having to, accommodate for the changes. This applies to the database part as well.
            </li>
            <li>The SQL string definitions were stored separate from the code and are hence easier to view and change as
                needed.
            </li>
            <li>It provides modularity of code and keeps the main script clean.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The json file generated has metadata on the first line, and the activities on their separate lines.
        <ul>
            <li>This is done to be able to parallelize the code if it were to work with a much larger dataset. The <em>json.loads</em>
                function cannot handle a large file as it parses all of it into memory.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="sqlite">SQLite</h4>
<ol>
    <li>The database engine is flexible in terms of use and has loose type definitions.</li>
    <li>It does not support Date and Time data types, hence the datetime fields are of type Integer so that it can be
        stored as Unix Epoch Time stamps.
        <ul>
            <li>This conversion is done in python while inserting into the DB for the &quot;performed_at&quot; field.
            </li>
            <li>This conversion is skipped for the &quot;shipment_date&quot; attribute, and is stored as the original
                string instead, as it is not needed for the future parts.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The schema for tickets was chosen to have the fields that may remain constant over the entire ticket (This may
        not necessarily be true for all fields and the tables can be modified according to need).
    </li>
    <li>The schema for activities has fields that can change during the ticket&#39;s journey, e.g., the &quot;priority&quot;
        could change over time.
    </li>
    <li>Users and Agents (employees) are created with random details when inserting tickets to the database, their
        tables are tokens, and can be changed according to actual needs.
    </li>
    <li>The Part 3 <a href="part3_query.sql">script</a> self joins the activity table for all getting all the necessary
        values in a single row.
        <ul>
            <li>The first 4 joins are done for getting the various statuses of a given ticket together.</li>
            <li>The last join collects the times when customer has been contacted and the <code>MIN()</code> along with
                <code>GROUP BY</code> determines the first activity of contact. According to assumption <code>4.v</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
